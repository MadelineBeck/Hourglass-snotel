# Hourglass-snotel
Code necessary to extract and run analysis for SNOTEL datasets available in the Bridger Mountain Range of Southwestern Montana.

## 01_MT_SNOTEL_Download:
This code uses capabilities from CUAHSI and the python package ULMO to download the most recent version of SNOTEL data from the Brackett Creek and Sacajawea SNOTEL sites in the Bridger Mountain Range of Southwestern Montana. High accuracy location datasets are also extracted and can be exported for visualization in QGIS. 

## 02_Bridger_snotel_vis:
This code uses seaborn plotting package to create visualizations for SNOTEL station temperature, snow depth, snow water equivalent, and precipitation trends for the entirety of their record period. Visualizations from this code should be used to create visuals for any publications to come from this data.
